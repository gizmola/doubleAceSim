# Double Aces Simulator

This is an html/css/javascript application that visually demonstrates the probability of drawing 2 Aces in a row from a standard Deck of playing `cards.

## Why?
This was inspired by Exercise 0.2 From the [The Nature of Code (2024 edition)](https://natureofcode.com/random/ "The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman")
I created this as an expanded exploraton of the Exercise.
